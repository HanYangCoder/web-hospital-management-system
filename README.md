# Online Hospital Management System
A web-based hospital management system  for our final project in our Client-Server Technologies and Applications subject.

This project is a simple webite that uses plain HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP as its web stack and uses MySQL for its database.

The web app will function as a management system that will show how many beds are available in that hospital as well as the doctors available for their services as of the moment.

The system will have two types accounts, an admin and a visitor side wherein the admin account are the ones responsible for managing that available beds as well as doctors availability time.
