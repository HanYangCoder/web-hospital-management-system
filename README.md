# Online Hospital Management System
A web-based hospital management system  for our Client-Server Technologies and Applications subject finals project.

This project will be a web-based output that will be using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP web 
stack and it will use MySQL for its database.

The web app will function as a management system that will show how many beds are available in that hospital
as well as the doctors available for their services as of the moment.
The system will have two types accounts, an admin and a visitor side wherein the admin account are the ones responsible 
for managing that available beds as well as doctors availability time.
